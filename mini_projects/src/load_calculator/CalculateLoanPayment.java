 * The CalculateLoanPayment class is a Java program that calculates and displays a loanâ€™s monthly payment, 
 * total payment over the loan term, and a detailed amortization schedule. It takes user input for the loan amount, 
 * annual interest rate, and loan duration, then computes monthly payments using the standard loan formula. 
 * The program dynamically updates the interest charged, principal paid, and remaining balance for each month, 
 * providing an accurate breakdown of how the loan is paid off over time.
